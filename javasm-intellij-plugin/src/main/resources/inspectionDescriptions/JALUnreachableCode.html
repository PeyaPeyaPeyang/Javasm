    This inspection analyzes all instructions in the code and reports instructions that are unreachable at runtime.
</p>
<p>
    An instruction is considered unreachable if the control flow cannot reach it due to preceding unconditional control
    transfer, such as jumps or method exits.
</p>
<p>
    The following instructions are considered to cause unconditional control flow termination:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>goto</code></li>
    <li><code>return</code></li>
    <li><code>ireturn</code>, <code>lreturn</code>, <code>freturn</code>, <code>dreturn</code>, <code>areturn</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>athrow</code></li>
    <li><code>tableswitch</code> and <code>lookupswitch</code> (when all branches jump away)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: <code>jsr</code> (jump to subroutine) is <strong>not</strong> considered to terminate control flow, as
    execution resumes after the subroutine completes.
</p>
<p>
    Instructions that follow such terminating instructions and are not the target of any jump or exception handler are
    flagged with a warning.
