    This inspection checks the declared fully qualified name of a class against its actual file path within the source
    root.
</p>
<p>
    A class is expected to be declared using a format like:
</p>
<pre><code>
public class java/lang/ExampleClass {
}
    </code></pre>
<p>
    The inspection ensures that the fully qualified name (e.g., <code>java/lang/ExampleClass</code>) matches the file
    system path under the source root.
    If there is a mismatch, it is highlighted as an error.
